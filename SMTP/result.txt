Problems faced during the project:

Sending the SMTP commands to the SMTP server in the correct format.The most difficult part was to send the data to SMTP server so the SMTP server puts the data into the body part of the email message.

Things learned during the completion of project:

1)Learned the basic concepts of python program.
2)Learned how SMTP protocol internally works.
3)Learned some of the classes include in MIME library.

Reviews of the project:

We have enjoyed the project,through it was a bit diffcult but it was worth to complete the project and we learned a lot of things due to it.
